            We have developed a flexible undergraduate curriculum that leverages the place‐based research of environmental microbiomes to increase the number of Indigenous researchers in microbiology, data science and scientific computing. Monitoring Environmental Microbiomes (MEM) provides a curriculum and research framework designed to integrate an Indigenous approach when conducting authentic scientific research and to build interest and confidence at the undergraduate level. MEM has been successfully implemented as a short summer workshop to introduce computing practices in microbiome analysis. Based on self‐assessed student knowledge of topics and skills, increased scientific confidence and interest in genomics careers were observed. We propose MEM be incorporated in a scalable course‐based research experience for undergraduate institutions, including tribal colleges and universities, community colleges and other minority serving institutions. This coupled curricular and research framework explicitly considers cultural perspectives, access and equity to train a diverse future workforce that is more informed to engage in microbiome research and to translate microbiome science to benefit community and environmental health.},

            Microorganisms synthesize small bioactive compounds through their secondary or specialized metabolism. Those compounds play an important role in microbial interactions and soil health, but are also crucial for the development of pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals. Over the past decades, advancements in genome sequencing have enabled the identification of large numbers of biosynthetic gene clusters directly from microbial genomes. Since its inception in 2011, antiSMASH (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/), has become the leading tool for detecting and characterizing these gene clusters in bacteria and fungi. This paper introduces version 8 of antiSMASH, which has increased the number of detectable cluster types from 81 to 101, and has improved analysis support for terpenoids and tailoring enzymes, as well as improvements in the analysis of modular enzymes like polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases. These modifications keep antiSMASH up-to-date with developments in the field and extend its overall predictive capabilities for natural product genome mining.},

            Galaxy (https://galaxyproject.org) is deployed globally, predominantly through free-to-use services, supporting user-driven research that broadens in scope each year. Users are attracted to public Galaxy services by platform stability, tool and reference dataset diversity, training, support and integration, which enables complex, reproducible, shareable data analysis. Applying the principles of user experience design (UXD), has driven improvements in accessibility, tool discoverability through Galaxy Labs/subdomains, and a redesigned Galaxy ToolShed. Galaxy tool capabilities are progressing in two strategic directions: integrating general purpose graphical processing units (GPGPU) access for cutting-edge methods, and licensed tool support. Engagement with global research consortia is being increased by developing more workflows in Galaxy and by resourcing the public Galaxy services to run them. The Galaxy Training Network (GTN) portfolio has grown in both size, and accessibility, through learning paths and direct integration with Galaxy tools that feature in training courses. Code development continues in line with the Galaxy Project roadmap, with improvements to job scheduling and the user interface. Environmental impact assessment is also helping engage users and developers, reminding them of their role in sustainability, by displaying estimated CO2 emissions generated by each Galaxy job.},

Based on tests with PacBio and Oxford Nanopore data sets, we show that Racon coupled with miniasm enables consensus genomes with similar or better quality than state-of-the-art methods while being an order of magnitude faster.},
